## Introduction
- Continuing workshop 1, I felt the completed background was missing something to make it more abstract, and bringing it to life. The workshop 1, where circles and shapes, popping out, seemed natural to bring visual interest, but I thought to myself that I wanted to make the sketch enjoyable for viewers (circles and shapes popping out). So I looked up into variables, focusing on creating repetitive lines which it'll enhance the rhythm and the flow of the composition.
- By adding it, it'll interact, with using the code mouseX and mouseY, and putting random numbers.

**adding crazy lines**
```ruby
  stroke(255, random(200)); 
  line(mouseX, mouseY, random(width), random(height));
```
